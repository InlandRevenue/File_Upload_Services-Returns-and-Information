## Release 2024 update details <a name="Release2024updatedetails"></a>

### Employee Details file upload service

Summary of major document updates for 2023/24 Year 
The following changes have been made to the relevant sections throughout the document and noted in the Change Log.  A summary is provided here for increased visibility of the updates. 

The ‘Payroll services filing’ section has been removed from the 2023/24 version of the Payday Filing File Upload Specification as this information is no longer relevant. The information contained in this section was retained for those employers needing to file an

## Release 2023 update details <a name="Release2023updatedetails"></a>

### Employee Details file upload service

Summary of major document updates for 2022/23 Year 
The following changes have been made to the relevant sections throughout the document 
and noted in the Change Log.  A summary is provided here for increased visibility of the 
updates. 

Negative Prior Period Adjustments 
From the date of Inland Revenue’s final Business Transformation release (currently 
scheduled for late October 2021), the prior period adjustment fields in the EI (‘Prior period 
gross adjustments’ and ‘Prior period PAYE adjustments’) will accept negative values.  
However, any negative amounts entered cannot be more than the corresponding amounts 
in the ‘Gross earnings and/or schedular payments’ field and ‘PAYE / tax’ field for the line 
item.  I.e. The line can be reduced to zero, but not below.

## Release 2022 update details <a name="Release2022updatedetails"></a>

### Employee Details file upload service

File Formats no longer available for use 
With the introduction of the new ED and EI file versions in April 2020, the following file 
formats will no longer be accepted: 
*  From 1 April 2021, the Employee Details file format with the header record indicator 
of **HED** will no longer be accepted.  The updated version of the Employee Details file 
format (header record indicator HED2) must be used.
*  For files with a **payday** of 1 April 2021 or later, the Employment Information file 
format with the header record indicator of **HEI** will not be accepted.  The updated 
version of the Employment Information file format (header record indicator HEI2) 
must be used. 
*  From 1 April 2021, the KiwiSaver Employment Details (**KS1**) form will no longer be 
accepted.  All details previously provided via this form should now be provided by 
using the HED2 version of the Employee Details file. 
>**Note:** The original EI Amendment file (header record indicator EIA) will still be available, as 
previously filed EI files with the header record indicator of HEI can only be amended with an 
EIA.  

### Tax threshold and rate change 

Proposed is a new tax threshold/rate of 39% for income over $180,000.  There are some 
consequential amendments which would impact payroll including: 
*  A new secondary tax code 
*  New rate for extra pays 
*  A new ESCT rate 
*  New rate and threshold for FBT calculations 

Refer to the Payroll Business Rules & Calculations Specification for further details of the 
impacts.

The impacted areas of this specification have been indicated and will be confirmed once this 
change becomes legislation.

> Prior period adjustment fields
> * If you already have a functioning amendment process, you do not have to use the prior period adjustment fields. You may continue to amend the incorrect returns.
